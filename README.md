# deep-learning-stories-analysis

This repository contains scripts that were used in the quantitative analysis in
my master thesis [_Deep Learning as a Socially Constructed
Technology_](https://is.cuni.cz/webapps/zzp/download/120290050) defended at
Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Social Sciences in 2017.

The scripts download blog posts and new stories targeted at audiences/social
groups for which deep learning is a relevant technology. The downloaded web
pages are then analyzed using TF-IDF and LDA.

Scripts for downloading and pre-processing the data are in the `data`
directory. Scripts for LDA and generating plots are in the `analysis`
directory.
